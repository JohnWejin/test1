Connecting to your Computational Resource
**************
Once you have received an email confirming the availability of your resource, you can begin using it. 
To begin using the resource, you need to be aware of the following;
1.	You need to log on to the resource using an SSH client (Windows Powershell, Windows CMD, Putty, MacOS Terminal, Linux Terminal etc) 
2.	You can connect to the resource over the internet or locally at Covenant University campus network
3.	Files can be transferred from/to computational resource using tools scp, rsync, or WinSCP (for window based Operating systems).
4.	Resources on the FEDGEN cloud testbed are used by different users therefore utmost responsibility is expected of each user. You are also responsible for the efficient management of Quota Resources assigned to you.
